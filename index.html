                            In order to participate in this contest, I have to become top 5 in my POSN centre,Samsenwittayalai School, which takes
                            a huge amount of time to pratice my competitive programming skill in such a limited time. As a result of the contest, I managed to become one of the Bronze medalists out of 90 participants.
                            This achievement is the proudest success which is able to ensure my talent in learning programming.

                            in topic of general-using program. My team ideated the project named Scam Buster with the purpose to distinguish scammers in online world by using various datas
                            about online scamming records.The project was successfully deployed in Android OS and we managed to get into final rounds of this competition.
                            As a result of long-time development, I have learnt many things, More than just usual programming, about using API and have had first touch with Front-End works.</p>

                            AI Development, Game Development, Front-End Development and Data Science also got my eyes on. After knowing about these interests,
                            I am no hesitate to start my learning path on every of them to find the best fit for me. In the end, I found that I love to do all of them
                            them with some greater attentiveness on Game Development since it is my first step on my way as developer.
